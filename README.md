# Performance Evaluation of Secure Systems and Networks Project - Punch'em Videogame

University project for **Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems and Networks** course (MSc Computer Engineering @ University of Pisa, A.Y. 2021-22).

The project aimed to design, model, and implement a system that simulated a fighting videogame, or even called **Punch'em Videogame**, and finally evaluate the overall performance in different scenarios. 
The project was developed and tested using Omnet++ 5.7 (on Ubuntu 20.04), while performance evaluation was studied through the production of graphs with spreadsheet software.
