# Performance Evaluation of Secure Systems and Networks Project - Punch'em Videogame

University project for **Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems and Networks** course (MSc Computer Engineering @ University of Pisa, A.Y. 2021-22).

The project aimed to design, model, and implement a system that simulates a fighting videogame, or even called Punch'em Videogame, and finally evaluate the overall system performance in different game scenarios.

The project was developed and tested using Omnet++ 5.7 (on Ubuntu 20.04), while performance evaluation was studied through the production of graphs with spreadsheet software.
